      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        Jen and David met in college in 2008 where they worked on the same nerdy extracurricular activity designed for “career readiness” and “perpetual success” (a student-run credit union). During our first meeting for the credit union, Jen was excited that David said he was “fresh off the boat from Shanghai”, because she was too! When she approached him about their similar backgrounds with excitement and desire for human connection, David shrugged it off and paid no attention to Jen. Luckily for David, he redeemed himself because they had adjacent shifts at the credit union and chatted frequently.

        They quickly became friends, but fell into their first date 9 months later. They were attending a group social activity to see the Philadelphia Orchestra, but ended up being the only two who showed up. David paid for Jen’s burrito at Qdoba and later that night, they watched “The Dark Knight” together at the Franklin Institute because Jen always shamefully admitted that she fell asleep the first time she watched the movie. They had a lovely time.

        Fast forward a few years: Jen moves to Boston, then David moves to New York, then Jen moves to Durham, then David moves to San Francisco… You get the idea... They spent 6 years apart, and talked over the phone every night. Maybe distance does make the heart grow fonder. David was finally able to convince Jen to relocate, and they reunited in San Mateo, at long last :)
